After an investor presets a take-profit order, if the market price reaches the trigger price set by the investor, the take-profit order will become a market order and will be executed at the best available market price at that time;",
  "止損單:止部單可幫助投資者減少損失。在投資者預設一個止損單後,如市場價格達到投資者設定的觸發價格時,止損單將會成為市價單,並以當時可執行的最後市場價格成交。": "Stop-Loss Order: A stop-loss order helps investors reduce losses. After an investor presets a stop-loss order, if the market price reaches the trigger price set by the investor, the stop-loss order will become a market order and will be executed at the last available market price at that time.",
  "請注意:任何訂單(包括止盈、止損等)均可能因為市場狀況的波動,受跳空的影響,而未必在預定的價格執行。如遇此情況,訂單會依照市場下一個最有利的價格執行。此外,投資者可在訂單被執行之前的交易時間內,隨時更改或取消各種訂單的設置,唯需符合我們對設置訂單的要求。": "Please Note: Any order (including take-profit and stop-loss orders) may be affected by market volatility and gaps, and may not be executed at the predetermined price.
